# `tfrepl`

Terraform REPL

Very hacky and alpha. Sort of a preview of `terraform console` _could_ be.

## vs `terraform console`

- (customizable and themable) Syntax highlighting
- Input history
- Creates a full root module to evaluate code in, rather than only evaluating expressions
- Supports multiline editing and editing via `EDITOR`
- Syntax sugar shortcuts not available in vanilla HCL
